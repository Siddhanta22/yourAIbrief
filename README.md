## 🚀 What is yourAIbrief?

**yourAIbrief** is a modern platform that:
- Curates the most credible, breaking, and relevant AI news from top sources
- Personalizes newsletters based on user-selected topics and interests
- Delivers news at the user’s preferred time and frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Presents content in a beautiful, multi-section email format
- Always ends with a fun, trending, or miscellaneous “What’s Popping in AI?” section

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Onboarding:**
   - Users subscribe and select their AI interests (e.g., Research, Industry, Tools, Ethics, etc.)
   - Users choose their preferred delivery time and frequency

2. **Content Curation:**
   - For each topic, the platform selects 4–5 top, credible, breaking stories from a strict whitelist
   - A final “What’s Popping in AI?” section features fun, trending, or quirky AI news from a broader set of sources (but never blocklisted)

3. **Newsletter Delivery:**
   - Newsletters are sent at the user’s chosen time, with each topic as a section and a fun ending
   - All emails are mobile-friendly, visually appealing, and easy to read
